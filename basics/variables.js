// Rule 1. Below an example of invalid variable, cannot define a variable twice

let petName = 'Jah'
//let petName = 'Spot'

//Below I have reassigned the variable value
petName = 'Spot'

console.log(petName)

// Rule 2. There are rules related to variable names
// Variable name has to start with a letter, $ or _. A number can never be the first character
let test_ = 2
let result = 3 - 4

// Rule 3. Variable names cannot be reserved keywords, for example the word let, it had s specific function so cannot be used as a vaiable
